/*
CCMATH REQUIREMENTS:
 * The entire library mandates everything MUST be constexpr. If it is not constexpr, it is not part of the library.
 * We do not allow exceptions.
 * We do allow static_asserts.
 * We must mimic the api of the standard cmath library.
 * Anything that could be considered UB is strictly forbidden.
 * Performance is are primary concern. Everything must be as fast as possible.
 * Anything implemented by cmath that is already constexpr is allowed to be wrapped by ccmath and not implemented by ccmath.


TODO: These are the functions that are currently located in cmath and are to be implemented
TODO: We don't have ti implement the entire API of cmath exactly how it is implemented in cmath. We allow for some flexibility in the API.
